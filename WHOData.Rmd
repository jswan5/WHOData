# Motivation


Now more than ever, health data is a major topic in society. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been inundated with statistics on infection rates, death rates, $R_0$ values, and many, many more. It has turned many people (for the better or for the worse) into armchair statisticians and data experts. Part of the increase is the wide availability of published data from various forms of governments, as well as the increased availability of tools and the resources to learn how to use them (e.g. R). The effect of these changes required only a catalyst, which COVID has served as, to allow people of all stripes to try their hand at more casual health data investigation.

Though we're investigating our chosen dataset with a less casual interest, the data we're looking at is widely available and has been for decades. Both governments and non-governmental organizations appreciate the value of population data, and there are no shortage of reliable repositories from which we can access the data. Given that we have the tools, the knowledge, and an ongoing grim reminder of the importance of public health, we've chosen exactly that as our data of interest.

Pushing COVID-19 from our minds for a minute, our focus is on public health in non-pandemic years. One of the primary measures when looking at population-level health data is life expectancy, both for its availability and ease of measurement. Though alternatives have been proposed (Stiefel, 2010), they don't have the widespread adoption, nor the clout. In addition to life expectancy, we'd like to investigate several other measurements that we could reasonably expect to be associated with increased longevity. Some of these factors are direct measures of public health, others are influenced heavily by government policy, and more yet are included to allow us to compare countries across the world. Thankfully this data has been collected for decades by the United Nations (UN) and it's related organizations.

When talking about countries at the world level, it would be difficult to compare them without mentioning basic metrics, such as population and gross domestic product (GDP). We hypothesize that GDP, expressed as per capita, will have a significant influence on many of the other public health measures. Availability of education is another metric that we're quite interested in, suspecting that it may be related to a country's GDP, though the direction of the relationship we don't want to speculate on just yet. Aside from GDP, the UN also provides an indicator known as Human Development Index (HDI) that brings together many of these variables. We won't be utilizing HDI, other than its role in classifying "developed" versus "developing" nations.

All of the data we're looking at is sourced from different UN agencies: the World Health Organization, the Global Health Observatory, and the World Bank. These agencies provide high-quality, easily accessible data from the UN's member states. Using this data, we want to analyze the factors that make a country desirable in each health data category, and see if we can identify any correlations. Once we've found variables of interest, we want to see if we can utilize linear regression to predict any missing data values we have, with a focus on life expectancy. The specific measurements we'll be looking at are:

**Schooling**
- Average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older, converted from education attainment levels using official durations of each level


# Correlation Plots

First off, we'll construct a correlation plot to identify correlations between our variables of interest. This will allow us to find meaningful relationships and narrow our focus on the measurements that we should investigate

## TABLE 1 - correlation plot between all listed variables
```{r}
# Filter numerics, print example data
num_data <- master_data[, c(3,4,6,7,8,9,10)]
head(num_data, 6)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Construct correlation matrices, drop NAs

cat("This table chows the numeric correlations between the variables:")

cor_chart <- cor(num_data, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")
round(cor_chart, 2)
```
\newpage

We can also visually demonstrate the correlations in a correlation plot, by combining data for all countries and all years:

## FIGURE 1 - Correlation Plot of All Numeric Variables
```{r}
ggcorrplot(cor_chart, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower", 
           outline.col = "white", 
           lab = TRUE, 
           title = "Correlation Plot of All Numeric Variables")

```
From the above plot, it's clear that the most positively correlated measurement with life expectancy is mean years of schooling, with a correlation coefficient of **0.74** (The highest absolute correlation with life expectancy, adult mortality, is expected, as the two measurements are slightly different ways of measuring the same outcome).

Within our data, the countries have been stratified by their deveopment status (i.e. developing versus developed). There are many factors that go in to how these classifications are made (United Nations, 2020), but we're interested in seeing the relationship between development status and life expectancy:

\newpage

# Life Expectancy and Development Status

## TABLE 2 - Development status
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Split data by development status
splitted <- master_data %>% 
  select(`Life Expectancy`, Status,`Mean years of schooling`)

splitted = na.omit(splitted)

detach("package:plyr", unload = TRUE) ##have to unload or summarize won't work

# Show the percentage of data contribution from Developing vs Developed 
splitted  %>% 
  group_by(Status) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = paste0(round(count/sum(count)*100, 2), "%"))
```
To focus on the comparison of developed vs developing countries summary, we have chosen to omit the NA values in the "splitted"" dataframe. This dataframe groups the countries by development staus and includes the two highly correlated variables life expectancy and mean years of schooling. Above is the count of listed developing countries versus developed countries, where the developing count is significantly higher than developed countries even after dropping NA values

## FIGURE 2 - Boxplot displaying Median of Developing vs Developed Country Status and Life Expectancy

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plyr)
# Plot box plots of the life expectancy data for developed/developing countries
p_meds <- ddply(splitted, .(Status), summarise, med = median(`Life Expectancy`))


plot1 <-  ggplot(splitted, aes(x=Status, y =`Life Expectancy` , fill = Status)) +
                geom_boxplot() +
                scale_fill_manual(values=c("honeydew", "coral")) +
                labs(x = "Country's Status", y = "Life Expectancy") +
                theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    geom_text (data = p_meds, aes(x = Status, y = med, label = med), size = 3, vjust = -1.5)  + ggtitle("Boxplot of Developed vs Developing Countries \n Life Expectancy with Median")


# show the plots
plot1
```
Based off the Median line on developed countries in the light green boxplot at 77.8, it is clear that developed countries have a much higher mean, median, and inter-qaurtile range for life expectancy.

\newpage

# Analysis of Variance

Test for estimating life expectancy variable changes according a country's development status. This will test whether there is a difference in means of the groups at each level of the independent variable. Test at signficance level of $\alpha=0.05$.

$H_0$: There is no difference in a country's development status and its corresponding mean life expectancy\
$H_a$: There is a difference in a country's development status and its corresponding mean life expectancy\ 

## TABLE 3 - ANOVA of Life Expectancy and Development Status
```{r}
# average varaince summary
summary(aov(`Life Expectancy` ~ Status, data = splitted ))
```
The resulting $p$-value is at $p<0.001$ from the ANOVA test, which is vanishingly small and far less than the significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$. Therefore, we can reject null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the life expectancy of developed versus developing countries.

## FIGURE 3 - Box Plots of Mean Years of Schooling and Development Status 
```{r, warning=FALSE}
q_meds <- ddply(splitted, .(Status), summarise, med = median(`Mean years of schooling`))


plot2 <-  ggplot(splitted, aes(x=Status, y =`Mean years of schooling`  ,  fill = Status)) +
                geom_boxplot() +
                scale_fill_manual(values=c("honey dew", "coral")) +
                labs(x = "Country's Status", y = "Mean years of schooling") +
                theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    geom_text (data = q_meds, aes(x = Status, y = med, label = med), size = 3, vjust = -1.5) + ggtitle("Boxplot of Developed vs Developing Countries \n Mean Year of Schooling with Median")


# show the plots
plot2
```
The above box plots show a stark difference in mean years of schooling between developed countries and developing countries, with the median years of schooling being over 4.5 years higher in developed countries (6.2 years versus 10.8 years). Similar to the life expectancy box plots, the mean schooling data shows that even developed countries in the 25th percentile receive more education (on average) than developing countries in the 75th percentile.

## TABLE 4 - ANOVA of Mean Years of Schooling and Development Status

$H_0$: There is no difference in a country's development status and its mean mean years of schhooling\
$H_a$: There is a difference in a country's development status and its mean years of schooling\


```{r}
summary(aov(`Mean years of schooling` ~ Status, data = splitted ))
```
As seen above, the ANOVA $p$-value of $p<0.001$ is far smaller than the significance level of $\alpha=0.05$, and we can reject null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in mean years of schooling in developed versus developing countries.

### What is the significance of these tests?

From these simple tests, we want to prove that:\
- 1)From the corrrealation plot, the amount of Schooling shows a positive correaltion to Life Expectancy, meaning that a higher education suggests a higher mortality.\
- 2) We now want to see the difference of Life Expectancy between a Developing Country and a Developed County, in other words, we identified that generally speaking Developed country have a longer lifespan.\
- 3) Then, if point two is true, then the average mean years of schooling must also be higher for Developed countries, and with no surprises, we proved that Developed countries recieves a higher education as well.\


# Linear Regression - Life Expectancy in Developed vs Developing Countries

In order to truly drive home the relationship between life expectancy and schooling from our dataset, we'll build a linear regression model:

$$
LifeExpectancy_{World, i} = \alpha + \beta *Schooling_{World, i} + e_{i}
$$


```{r}
# Prepare data

splitted2 <- master_data %>% 
  select( Country, Year, `Life Expectancy`, Status,`Mean years of schooling`)

splitted2 = na.omit(splitted2)

head(splitted2, 10)

```
\newpage

## World Linear regression model predicting Life Expectancy(y) by Mean years of Schooling(x)
```{r}
# Make plots and the regression line

world_fit = lm(`Life Expectancy`~ `Mean years of schooling`, data = splitted2)
print(world_fit)
```
```{r}
ggplot(splitted2, aes(`Mean years of schooling`, `Life Expectancy`))  +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) + 
  xlim(0, 15) + 
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of World \n Mean Years of Schooling and Average Life Expectancy \n 2000-2016") +  
  theme (
plot.title = element_text(color="red", 
                          size=12, 
                          face="bold.italic")) + geom_abline(slope = coef(world_fit)[[2]], intercept = coef(world_fit)[[1]], col = "red")
```
\newpage

From the scatter plot and linear regression line we see a increase in life expectancy across the world as the level of education (as mean years of schooling) increases. Although there are few outliers, none seem to be high leverage, so this seems to be an appropriate fit for this model.

All the same, we'll run model diagnostics to verify it:

```{r}
summary(world_fit)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))  # set up a 2 rows and 2 columns plotting environment

plot(world_fit)
```
The top left, and bottom left plots check the linearity assumption and the equal variance assumption. When these assumptions are met, we expect the plotted points evenly distributed in a rectangular region. We see a very small deviation from horizontal, but nothing of major concern.

The top right plot checks the normality assumption. If the assumption is met, we expect to see a straight line pattern. We see very minimal departures at the lower and upper tails, but overall a relatively straight line.

The bottom right plot checks for influential data points, of which none seem to be too worrisome.

Regarding the test statistics, the overall $F$-test ($F$-statistic = **3210** on 1 and 2666 DoF, $p < 0.0001$ and the individual *t* tests ($p$-value for intercept is $p<0.0001$, $p$-value for slope is $p<0.0001$) all suggest that the fitted model is highly statistically significant. The coefficient of determination is $R^2=0.5463$.

# Prediction intervals

# Multilinear Regression: Developed vs Developing

Since we can clearly identify a strong linear relationship between mean years of schooling across all countries using the linear model world_fit, let's dive into adding GDP per capita(USD) to predict the life expectancy of a developing versus developed country along with the mean years of schooling.

```{r}

# Prep the data for Developed country

status_df <- master_data %>% 
  select(`Life Expectancy`, Status,`Mean years of schooling`, `GDP per capita (USD)`)

status_df = na.omit(status_df)

# Split the date in two groups

status_df = split(status_df, status_df$Status)

# Prepare variables by development status

developed_life = status_df$Developed$`Life Expectancy`
developed_school = status_df$Developed$`Mean years of schooling`
developed_gdp = status_df$Developed$`GDP per capita (USD)`

# Make the multiple regression model

multi_model <- lm(developed_life ~ developed_school + developed_gdp , data = status_df$Developed)

summary(multi_model)
summary(multi_model)$coefficient
```

The overall $F$-test ($F$-statistic: 415.2 on 2 and 931 DF,  $p < 0.0001$) and the individual *t* tests ($p$-value for intercept is $p<0.0001$, $p$-value for slope is $p<0.0001$) all suggest that the fitted model is highly statistically significant. The coefficient of determination is $R^2=0.4715$ using both mean year of schooling and GDP per capita to estimate life expectancy for developed countries. This means 47.15% of the variance in the measure of developed country's life expectancy can be predicted by developed country's mean years of schooling and GDP per capita, which is quite high. 

Using the data as an example: the estimate GDP per capita is 1.129e-04, meaning an increase in average GDP of $20,000 adds 2.26 years to life expectancy.

\newpage

From the statistical findings above we now build  our model equation as follows:

$$
LifeExpectancy_{Developed, i} = 72.8938 + 0.1337 *Schooling_{Developed, i} + 0.0001*GDPperCap{Developed, i}
$$

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# The confidence interval of the model coefficient

confint(multi_model)

#Residual Standard Error (RSE)

cat("The standard error is:", 
    round(sigma(multi_model)/mean(status_df$Developed$`Life Expectancy`), 4), 
    "which proves this model accuracy is reliable." )
```


```{r}
# plot the model

ggplot(status_df$Developed,aes(y=developed_life,x=developed_school,color=developed_gdp))+geom_point(size = 0.7)+stat_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) + ggtitle("Developed Country Life Expectancy \n Predcting by GDP per Capita \n and Mean Years of Schooling") + theme (
plot.title = element_text(color="red", size=12, face="bold.italic")) + scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(5))
```
Above is a representation of the multiple regression model, using colour as a scale to show GDP per capita.

```{r}

# prep the data for Developing country

developing_life = status_df$Developing$`Life Expectancy`
developing_school = status_df$Developing$`Mean years of schooling`
developing_gdp = status_df$Developing$`GDP per capita (USD)`


#make the multilinear regression model

multi_model2 <- lm(developing_life ~ developing_school + developing_gdp, data = status_df$Developing)

summary(multi_model2)
summary(multi_model2)$coefficient

cat("The overall F-test ( F-statistic: 546.7 on 2 and 1688 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16) and the individual *t* tests (P-value for intercept is <2e-16, P-value for slope is <2e-16) all suggest that the fitted model is highly statistically significant. The coefficient of determination is R^2= 0.3931 using both mean year of schooling and gdp per capita to estimate life expectancy for developing countries. This means 39.31% of the variance in the measure of Developing Countries Life expectancy can be predicted by Developing countries mean years of schooling and gdp per capita.")


```
From the statistical findings above we now build  our model equation as follows:
$$
LifeExpectancy_{Developing, i} = 53.5783 + 1.601 *Schooling_{Developing, i} + 0.0006*GDPperCap{Developing, i}
$$
```{r}
ggplot(status_df$Developed,aes(y=developed_life,x=developed_school,color=developed_gdp))+geom_point(size = 0.7)+stat_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) + ggtitle("Developing Country Life Expectancy \n Predcting by GDP per Capita \n and Mean Years of Schooling") + theme (
plot.title = element_text(color="blue", size=12, face="bold.italic")) + scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(7))


```

# Conclusion

It would appear that there indeed a very strong link between GDP, schooling, and life expectancy. The interaction seems to be quite intricate, as all three variables seem to increase (or decrease) hand-in-hand. As these are some of the main conditions that make a country developed versus developing, it should come as no surprise that there's a stark difference between the two statuses of countries.
